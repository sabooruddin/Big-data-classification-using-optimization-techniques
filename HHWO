Selecting genes from RNA-Seq data with MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) feature selection and optimizing the selected genes using a hybrid HHO (Harris Hawk Optimization) and WOH (Whale Optimization) algorithm would typically involve a series of steps and coding. Here's a simplified Python code example to get you started. Keep in mind that you may need to adapt this code to your specific dataset and requirements.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from skfeature.function.information_theoretical_based import MRMR
from skfeature.utility import construct_W
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sko.HHO import HHO
from sko.WOA import WOA

# Load your RNA-Seq data
# Replace X and y with your data and target labels
X, y = load_your_data_here()

# Step 1: MRMR feature selection
# Calculate the mutual information between features and labels
mi = MRMR.mrmr(X, y, n_selected_features=your_desired_num_features)

# Sort features by mutual information
sorted_features = np.argsort(mi)[::-1]

# Select the top features
selected_features = X[:, sorted_features[:your_desired_num_features]]

# Step 2: Hybrid Optimization with HHO and WOH
# Define the fitness function for optimization (e.g., classification accuracy)
def fitness_function(selected_genes):
    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(selected_genes, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest)
    clf = RandomForestClassifier()
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate accuracy as the fitness value
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    return -accuracy  # Negative to maximize accuracy

# Set the optimization parameters
dim = your_desired_num_features  # Number of selected genes
hho = HHO(func=fitness_function, dim=dim, size_pop=10, max_iter=50)
woa = WOA(func=fitness_function, dim=dim, max_iter=50, lb=[0] * dim, ub=[1] * dim)

# Run the optimization algorithms
best_genes_hho, _ = hho.run()
best_genes_woa, _ = woa.run()

# Combine the results from HHO and WOA if needed
# For example, you can choose the best genes from both algorithms

# Now, best_genes_hho and best_genes_woa contain the optimized selected genes

# You can use these genes for downstream analysis or modeling
```

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may require additional customization and validation to suit your specific dataset and objectives. You should replace the data loading part and parameter values with your actual data and requirements.
